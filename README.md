# Sokoban game

The goal is to build flexible testable model of the game, and make IO layer as thin as possible.

Also the game should implement advanced move-ability control with reachability test, and such algorithms
are usually hard to implement in Haskell, but in this project it is achieved nevertheless, see
[`Solver.hs`](src/Sokoban/Solver.hs) module.

### Installation and run
                        
You need to have [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/) installed.

```
stack build
stack exec sokoban
```

### Requests for the improvement. 

1. ‚òë Track `steps` and `pushes`.
1. ‚òë Implement mouse events and reaction on `MoveBox Point Point`, `MoveWorker Point`
    (this is pretty hard, since it requires path finding algorithm implemented for with
    pushes or steps optimization).
1. ‚òë Parse command line options with `optparse-applicative`.
1. ‚çª Replays and stored solutions.
1. ‚çª Local storage to store solved/unsolved, progress and score board.
1. ‚çª Solver, that tries to find the solution from the current position
    (should be cancellable).
1. ‚çª Deadlock detection (similar to the feature above, but can be done 
    with brute-force algorithm).
1. ‚çª Application configuration and monad transformers stack `ReaderT` with it.
1. ‚çª Include `RandomMonad` into the transformers stack to randomly select 
    the next level.
1. ‚çª Implement a web version for the game, i.e. write the REST interface 
    using [servant](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant).
1. ‚çª Write a frontend in ELM language.
1. ‚çª Write TUI using [brick](https://github.com/jtdaugherty/brick).
