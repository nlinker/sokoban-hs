# Sokoban game

The goal is to build flexible testable model of the game, and make IO layer as thin as possible.

Also the game should implement advanced move-ability control with reachability test, and such algorithms
are usually hard to implement in Haskell, but in this project it is achieved nevertheless, see
[`Solver.hs`](src/Sokoban/Solver.hs) module.

### Installation and run
                        
You need to have [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/) installed.

```
stack build
stack exec sokoban
```

### Requests for the improvement. 

1. ☑ Track `steps` and `pushes`.
1. ☑ Implement mouse events and reaction on `MoveBox Point Point`, `MoveWorker Point`
    (this is pretty hard, since it requires path finding algorithm implemented for with
    pushes or steps optimization).
1. ☑ Parse command line options with `optparse-applicative`.
1. ☑ Implement animations.
1. ⍻ Replays and stored solutions.
